  Fun fact. In terms of weight to unleveled HP, the Firewall and Stance shields are at 1:50. Svalinn meanwhile is 1:65.... but Ajax is 1:62.5 and Tower is 1:66.7!
  So Yeah.
  I've left Tower and Svalinn alone, and buffed everybody else up to Svalinn's 1:65 level- be that by lowering mass or adding/rearranging stats.
  While I can agree that more weight should get slightly better returns, Firewall was the second-heaviest and nerfing Tower's ratio would risk making it unusable.
  I've also standardized the Barrier levels (outside of Tower) to the same level as Stance/Svalinn, as that "felt right" so to speak.
