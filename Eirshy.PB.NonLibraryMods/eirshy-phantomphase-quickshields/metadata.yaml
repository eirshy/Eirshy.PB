  A concept by Phantom Phase under contract by Knight House Pipkin, the 'QuickShield' operates similar to a standard Shield, but with a drastically reduced active interval- 0.6s instead of the industry standard 1.7s.
  The majority of pilots find the increase reduces their performance, as they most often triple-queue the action for a net loss 0.1s... However, a stalwart few claim the higher resolution has allowed them a significant advantage when outnumbered, warranting the slim costs.
